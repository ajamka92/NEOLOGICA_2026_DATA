Description: A dataset of neologisms in Spanish fat liberation discourse (2021 to 2025). The dataset contains:

preliminary verification of lexical units documented by Guerrero Salazar (2020) in the study corpusc, and

a final list of neologisms annotated with part of speech, word-formation process (OBNEO 2025), referent type, ideological value (normative/subversive), ideological frame, and discursive function.

Lexical units were extracted from ASR-generated transcripts of the podcast Nadie hablará de nosotras (episodes downloaded from iVoox and processed with MacWhisper). Transcripts were uploaded and compiled into a corpus using Sketch Engine. The dataset is intended as a supplementary material to the article A. JAMKA, FAT LIBERATION, DISCOURSE, AND LEXICAL INNOVATION: A CORPUS STUDY OF NEOLOGISMS IN NADIE HABLARÁ DE NOSOTRAS.
